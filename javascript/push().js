/* Manipulate Arrays With push() */

var arr1 = [1,2,3];
arr1.push(4);
// arr1 is now [1,2,3,4]

var arr2 = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
arr2.push(["happy", "joy"]);
// arr2 now equals ["Stimpson", "J", "cat", ["happy", "joy"]]


/** 
An easy way to append data to the end of an array is via the push() function.
.push() takes one or more parameters and "pushes" them onto the end of the array.
